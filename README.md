# Real Time Bus Tracker

This was another project to showcase my ability to work with external API requests and asynchronous code.  This project follows one of the Massachesetts public transportation buses around the city in real time plotting its gps location every 15 seconds.

• click on the 'show location' button

• scroll to zoom in and see a more precise location for the bus.

• watch as every 15 seconds the gps coordinates are logged to the page below.
